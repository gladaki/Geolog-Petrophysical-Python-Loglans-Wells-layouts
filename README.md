# Geolog Python loglan, layouts, data and wells examples
The objective of this project is to present a variety of Geolog loglans that have been written in python to demonstrate the capabilities of Geolog python loglan where all well data is being sourced from a Geolog well. 


## At this time there are four (4) different projects
	- Demonstrate the use of Time-series Production data from 3 fields using Altair
	- Demonstrate the use of Altair in interrogating the Capillary Pressure data from Clerke's Rosetta Stone Carbonate Dataset
	- Demonstrate the usefulness of a Geolog loglan written in python for Waxman-Smits analysis 
	- A rather holistic Clastic Example that demonstrates the following:
		- Altair interrogation of log data
		- Core calibrated NMR data trained to predict permeability using kNN
		- Generate Thomeer parameters and Capillary Pressure curves from core calibrated porosity and permeability using kNN
		- Thomeer-based Capillary Pressure saturations
		- Using kNN generate representative Thin Sections over a well profile
		- Waxman-Smits Saturations with plots out of Geolog and a Jupyter Notebook to serve as the help file
